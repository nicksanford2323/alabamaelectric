  "text": "Run don’t walk away from this electrician. Actually to call this person an electrician is an insult to all electricians everywhere. They were asked to add an outlet in the hallway of this home and they used a hammer to knock a hole in the paneling and just shoved an outlet in the hole without a junction box and they connected the outlet to a circuit that was ungrounded so he cut the ground wire out and didn’t gfi protect it. This guy made many, many other code violations in this house. And I would be surprised if this person were actually licensed with the state. If they are licensed they need to be reported to the state board of licenses for official review. Anyone who willfully violates Electrical codes with this much reckless abandon and actually charges people for it needs to be run out of business. I say all of this because I am a state licensed master electrician and I was called in to clean up this guys mess.",

He came out and provided a quote the next day. He assured me he knew how to complete this job and had experience. The next day I had 3 guys show up who had no idea how to do anything with LED lighting. They were asking me questions how to wire it up even after I handed them instructions from everything. They said they were done in 4 hours. When I turned on my LED lights in the master bedroom they were strobing and flickering. The crew left anyway after showing them this. I didn't feel so great about it and had more electrical work to be completed but I was waiting on items to arrive in the mail. I called another electrician out and he went through everything. The flickering with the LED lights was from a ground not connected in the light switch box in the bedroom. The power supplies in the attic to the LEDs were wired wrong entirely. The power inverter to power the wall control panel had wiring going to a power supply which should have never happened. The power supplies have their own dedicated power already in the attic within a few feet and this was explained several times. The crew did not appear to be legitimate electricians and I ended up paying another electrician double to come back and fix the mess they installed. The electrician that came out actually knew how to install LED lighting. I contacted Mr. Beasley about the installation through text message explaining my situation with no response. I gave him the opportunity to make it right. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE A JOKE.\n\nMr. Beasley, this review will cost you more business than if you had just made it right.\nThanks",

I don’t know if there was a misunderstanding regarding what materials would be available at our house, but Chris chose to get an attitude with me instead of trying to find out what happened. I had simply asked him to come troubleshoot a light in our laundry room and I did not know if we had a wiring problem or what parts might be required to either repair the existing fixture or replace it with a new one. Chris said it was an old fixture and needed to be replaced and that he doesn’t keep them in his truck. I told him I could go pick one up and he clearly became frustrated that we didn’t already have one. He said “this is messed up” and “we drove a long way out here”. That’s when I said I’d pay him for a service call so they can be on their way. I don’t understand how someone could be so unprofessional with a long standing and well established customer.

He had all the necessary parts needed and worked with me for the best placement of the box.  He was efficient and left the area cleaner than it was when he arrived.\n\nI used A-1 a couple of years ago for a problem in the same out-building.  Turned out to be a loose breaker.  Didn't have a problem  with his service then either - which is why I called him for my new circuit.\n\nI've been thinking about going solar and found out Leonard is also very knowledgeable about solar. After he installed my RV circuit we discussed what would be needed and a very rough estimate so I could get an idea of the costs.  If/when I decide to make the Solar plunge I'll be calling Leonard for a more comprehensive estimate. I've spoken to a Solar Company in Birmingham and they were a joke.  Their prices were outrageous and got to the point they wouldn't return phone calls.  I got the complete opposite with A-1.\n\nLeonard is no nonsense and ethical and will tell you like it is.  If he sees a problem or something unsafe he'll tell you.\n\nI'm fairly new to the Cullman area and have had problems finding good contractors/plumbers/electricians.  A-1 is my go to Company for any electrical work needed.",

Almost all of my basement electrical work was already in place because I was putting a one bedroom apartment in where a one bedroom apartment used to be. I simply needed some finishing work done. After he left he called the city to request they put a stop work order on me. The City inspector was at my house within 15 minutes. It turned out to be the best thing he could've done for me. The city inspector told me neither my breaker box nor my outside meter needed replacing. They did not put a stop work order on me because almost all my electrical work was pre-existing. Turns out A1 was just feeding me a line to run up a huge estimate for things that did not need replacing. They'll never get my business. They aren't trustworthy and they're willing to tell you things need replacing when they don't just to run up the bill. His estimate to finish wiring 2 rooms where most of the electrical was already in place from the previous apartment was almost 5k. I'm really glad the inspector came out and let me know most of the estimate wasn't required to pass an inspection. I'm now free to find an honest electrician. I plan to call a couple of them on Monday. If this guy gives you an estimate plz be sure to get a second opinion. It could save you thousands.",

I called Tyler several times and other people answered the phone, but never called me back. If he has insurance, this is what it's for, so it shouldn't be a big deal. He lost all my trust.",

He went up into my attic and discovered that someone (previous owner?) had spliced an additional electric line into the existing living room line.\n\nThat splice job had apparently come loose a few days ago and started to arc. The splice wasn't even contained within an electrical box. It was just wire nutted and taped. Dan cut out and brought down the old splice and you could smell that it had burned.\n\nDan mounted a proper electrical box in the attic and connected the wiring up to code.\n\nHis willingness to investigate something that he wasn't even originally hired for, most likely saved my house from burning down.\n\nIf that doesn't qualify as a real recommendation, I don't know what would.",

He was meticulous in his work, paying attention to every detail, and the result was a clean, efficient setup that works perfectly.\n\nWhat really stood out was his commitment to safety and quality. He double-checked all the connections and even gave me a thorough walkthrough of how to use the charger effectively. His expertise gave me complete confidence that the job was done right.\n\nAnd to top it all off, his pricing was the best in town! I did my research beforehand, and master electrician offered the most competitive rate without compromising on quality.\n\nIf you're looking for an electrician who is not only skilled but also genuinely cares about delivering top-notch service at a great price, I highly recommend master electrician, I will definitely be calling him for any future electrical needs.

I left a msg, explaining my problem the best I could, 4 minutes later I received a text stating they would be there in the morning & it asking for my address. I sent the address & wrote I had to be some place by 9 am. I got a text back immediately that they would see me at 7:30 in the morning. They texted to say they were on their way. A phone call saying they were here & asked if my dogs would bite, plus asked if it was it OK to come onto the property due to my threatening no tresspassing sign, lol. The problem was more than my phone msg stated, oops, I didn't know how bad it was. BUT after giving me an estimate they went & got the needed parts immediately. The estimate was very reasonable, the final cost was within the estimate. Since the power company had to come shut off the at the pole before the work could be done safely, the wait for them to come back to turn it back on seemed like forever. After the power company turned the power back on & they made sure everything outside was working correctly They did come in the house to turn the inside breaker on to be certain that everything worked correctly & to be sure I was satisfied with the work before they left.\nI would highly recommend them.\nAn estimate was given & approved prior to work starting\nPrices are extremely reasonable.\nCommunication is great.\nThey knew I needed to get the electric running quickly & did the job in a timely manner.\nThey did not leave before knowing I was satisfied with the job.",

He walked through the house plans with us and asked us what we wanted. But he also thought of things that we did not think of like lights in some of our attic spaces and crawl space, door bells, under cabinet lights and\nexhaust fans. He does not cut corners. He uses heavier gauge line and does each job like it is his own. He is very responsive. He shows up when he says he will and he will treat you with respect. After dealing with many different sub contractors, I can honestly say Chris has been the easiest to work with and his work was one of the few which was done right the first time.

And, after discussing the insulation work I was going to start on, he noticed the venting that I hadn't considered and told me how I can insulate the roof and lofts and keep the vents still open.  I not only have an electrician I trust for future work but I also consider him a trusted friend now.",

The utility company came out to the house and cut the power to prevent a fire. I called Troy and he was at the house the next day to do the work. Not only did he repair the meter, he called and coordinated the inspection and had the utility company come back out and restore the power all on the same day of the repair. He was in constant communication with me letting me know what was happening each step; and went above and beyond by going back and forth to my house to meet the Inspector and double check to make sure the power was restored. For all of his hard work, his price was \"extremely\" reasonable. Without a doubt, I would recommend Troy to anyone needing any electrical work. Thank you so much for getting my power back on.

I requested a quote to run power out to our barn and he came and not only gave a quote but finished the project sooner then was expected. I wanted to surprise my husband with this venture before he came home from his hunting trip. I had mentioned this to Mr. Echols, that I just wanted to at least get a quote before my husband came home. He promptly asked my husband’s return date and not only met it but did so without pressure of me asking. Like I said, above my expectations. The day he came to do the work was the day my husband was returning, he kept asking when I expected his arrival time. He almost met it, would it have not been for the foundation of our garage. I am glad Mr. Echols was just finishing up when my husband pulled in because he could meet Mr. Echols and go over all of the technical stuff that was done. Not only would I recommend his services, I will be using them again soon for an upcoming project. Mr. Echols has made our prestigious list of servicemen we trust, will recommend and will use again. Thank you Mr. Echols for doing a great job and helping me keep the ‘spark’ in my marriage. Lol <— see what I did there? :-)",

This is a guy that charges a fortune ($120/hr), lies, misrepresents himself, does not give invoice until after you have paid, charged for drive to Home Depot, and had the audacity to talk bad about another lady he was working for that complained about the ridiculous high price charged!! He truly charges more an hour than Physicians charge for surgery!! My exhusband had utilized him to change out our doorbell. (One of pics available) Well after I dealt with Vance and his girlfriend I complained to my ex (was one reason I used Vance to work on my outside lights for safety reasons) So come to find out Vance had charged my ex a huge amount but I was not aware. When I received the invoice AFTER I had written check I saw how much was charged-even $200 for another guy to climb a ladder to change light. I am now living on a fixed income and to have paid all this money made me so upset at the time but the fact it’s been a a year and a half I am furious when I think of him and what he did to me. And he bought a light set that was the exact same unit. And when he took the old one to his van to use I noticed and asked for it to donate to some one that may need he made a remark. Well not until he left did I realize the box was the exact same. I called the girlfriend because she was kind to me. I told her I felt he needed to return some of the funds, especially since I could have saved over a hundred driving to buy parts. Keep in mind his family has lived in my neighborhood for many years. But I told the girlfriend if he chose to continue in bad business practices I would write it off as huge lesson learned. And keep in mind Vance was working as a journeyman.",
