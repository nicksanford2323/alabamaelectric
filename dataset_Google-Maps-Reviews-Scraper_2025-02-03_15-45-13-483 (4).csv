"Run don’t walk away from this electrician. Actually to call this person an electrician is an insult to all electricians everywhere. They were asked to add an outlet in the hallway of this home and they used a hammer to knock a hole in the paneling and just shoved an outlet in the hole without a junction box and they connected the outlet to a circuit that was ungrounded so he cut the ground wire out and didn’t gfi protect it. This guy made many, many other code violations in this house. And I would be surprised if this person were actually licensed with the state. If they are licensed they need to be reported to the state board of licenses for official review. Anyone who willfully violates Electrical codes with this much reckless abandon and actually charges people for it needs to be run out of business. I say all of this because I am a state licensed master electrician and I was called in to clean up this guys mess.",,"shane roney","ChIJbResCMXci4gRhUm-sHyKYmU","1"

"Ok, so they have a $150 fee to come out. It's honestly worth it. We had 4 outlets stop working entirely in our tiny home and didn't know what to do because nothing seemed wrong. Two guys showed up. They were as prepared as they could ever be, found the wire problem (that was in the ceiling, mind you), and got us back to full operation within an hour. They were good sports too, even explained what they were doing in a way I could understand. 10/10 would and will call again when something else happens.

"Dr. Watts electrical company is incredible -

2 days ago, my family’s A/C and dryer were not getting any electricity from our house’s breaker box due to a malfunction. After consulting with two other electricians, I was being told that the only solution would be to replace the entire breaker box - a solution that is not simple nor cheap.

However, we called Dr. Watts as a final hope and he came through. And it only took 25 minutes.

Not only did he fix our A/C and dryer’s electrical issues, he actually took the time the fix up the rest of our electrical wiring in the breaker box, and then explained to my wife and I the work he did, and why what he did was successful.

I will be contacting Dr. Watts for any and all services, and I highly recommend him as the go-to electrician in the Fort Novosel / Enterprise / Daleville / Ozark / Dothan Alabama area.",,"Nicholas J. VanSlyke","ChIJVwTi2JSLkogRBeZowVrmK-Y","5"

"I really wished my husband called for a estimate first but he was too sick to make that decision and we had a breaker going out. However the part only cost $140 and they charged us $$203 then on top of that $150 labor. We had no problem with the labor part of it  but overcharging for parts is pathetic.  We will pass this down to family and friends and tell them not to use you guys. Also the last 2 review comments is from someone in the company anyway so of course the comments are going be positive. This company is a greedy company and only to gain profit from overcharging parts.  Now they may see this and do better. I cannot say but they won't be getting our buisness

The entire process was smooth and hassle-free. They provided a detailed estimate, outlining the scope of the work, costs, and a reasonable timeline for completion. This level of transparency was greatly appreciated.

He arrived on time, and his work was nothing short of impeccable. They took great care to ensure that the new plugs were not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. The attention to detail was evident, and the finished work blended seamlessly with my home's existing electrical setup.

What truly sets them apart is their commitment to customer satisfaction. They went above and beyond to answer my questions and address any concerns I had during and after the installation.

In summary, Bledsoe’s Electrical exceeded my expectations in every aspect of the plug installation. Their professionalism, attention to detail, and dedication to customer satisfaction make them the go-to choice for electrical work.

I explained the issues, and he patiently listened; I could see he was thinking and processing the information. He set off to investigate, and within about 20 minutes, he said he knew what the problem was and got to work.
There were wires crossed and bad grounds all over the house. He has been out several times now and has fixed so much bad wiring, run new wires, put in a new panel, added new circuits, etc.
I can’t say enough how grateful we are to have found him.",,"Jason Campbell","ChIJS_PBNZLqem8RtCtpOFTbIPY","5"

"I had the owner come out to my home to give me an estimate on my electrical work. It involved installing commercial grade LED lighting in a renovation project I have been working on. He came out and provided a quote the next day. He assured me he knew how to complete this job and had experience. The next day I had 3 guys show up who had no idea how to do anything with LED lighting. They were asking me questions how to wire it up even after I handed them instructions from everything. They said they were done in 4 hours. When I turned on my LED lights in the master bedroom they were strobing and flickering. The crew left anyway after showing them this. I didn't feel so great about it and had more electrical work to be completed but I was waiting on items to arrive in the mail. I called another electrician out and he went through everything. The flickering with the LED lights was from a ground not connected in the light switch box in the bedroom. The power supplies in the attic to the LEDs were wired wrong entirely. The power inverter to power the wall control panel had wiring going to a power supply which should have never happened. The power supplies have their own dedicated power already in the attic within a few feet and this was explained several times. The crew did not appear to be legitimate electricians and I ended up paying another electrician double to come back and fix the mess they installed. The electrician that came out actually knew how to install LED lighting. I contacted Mr. Beasley about the installation through text message explaining my situation with no response. I gave him the opportunity to make it right. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE A JOKE.

Mr. Beasley, this review will cost you more business than if you had just made it right.

Unfortunately, my most recent experience was the exact opposite. I don’t know if there was a misunderstanding regarding what materials would be available at our house, but Chris chose to get an attitude with me instead of trying to find out what happened. I had simply asked him to come troubleshoot a light in our laundry room and I did not know if we had a wiring problem or what parts might be required to either repair the existing fixture or replace it with a new one. Chris said it was an old fixture and needed to be replaced and that he doesn’t keep them in his truck. I told him I could go pick one up and he clearly became frustrated that we didn’t already have one. He said “this is messed up” and “we drove a long way out here”. That’s when I said I’d pay him for a service call so they can be on their way. I don’t understand how someone could be so unprofessional with a long standing and well established customer.

They were booked up but Ronnie agreed to swing by and see if anything could be done.  In 3 hours, they had run all the wires and set the key outlets so that the work could continue.  Because of their work, my kitchen was completed enough that we could enjoy the new grill for Memorial Day weekend.  They will be back this week to finish trimming out the remaining outlets and installing the lights that i purchased over the weekend.

We were very specific on the phone that payment was to be handled over the phone by us, and to not even bother her at all. but instead two strange men knocked on her door and proceeded to stand in her home for almost 45 minutes while frequently reminding her that every moment they were there would cost more money. When payment was finally handled, one of the men chose to share that he served 2 years in prison. That combined with his rude demeanor severely frightened her and she ended up not feeling comfortable spending the night in her own home.

"I had Leonard install an outside 30AMP receptacle on my outbuilding for my RV a couple of weeks ago. He was very easy to communicate with for the appointment, contacted me the morning of the appointment and  his navigation system gave up-to-the minute arrival details.  He had all the necessary parts needed and worked with me for the best placement of the box.  He was efficient and left the area cleaner than it was when he arrived.

I used A-1 a couple of years ago for a problem in the same out-building.  Turned out to be a loose breaker.  Didn't have a problem  with his service then either - which is why I called him for my new circuit.

I've been thinking about going solar and found out Leonard is also very knowledgeable about solar. After he installed my RV circuit we discussed what would be needed and a very rough estimate so I could get an idea of the costs.  If/when I decide to make the Solar plunge I'll be calling Leonard for a more comprehensive estimate. I've spoken to a Solar Company in Birmingham and they were a joke.  Their prices were outrageous and got to the point they wouldn't return phone calls.  I got the complete opposite with A-1.

Leonard is no nonsense and ethical and will tell you like it is.  If he sees a problem or something unsafe he'll tell you.

I'm fairly new to the Cullman area and have had problems finding good contractors/plumbers/electricians.  A-1 is my go to Company for any electrical work needed.",,"E Gilbreath","ChIJz-6Re8zLiYgRoeb_SE-zVsY","5"

He was always professional, corteous, on time, and explained everything he did. A couple of weeks later our water heater broke. He came back out for free and after proving the problem wasn't related to his work, he recommended replacing the water heater, and explained how to do it. I decided instead to replace the heating element, since a new element would only cost $20. Leonard spent half of Sunday walking me through on the phone how to replace it, and now I have hot water again.

"He came to my house and told me my entire breaker box as well as my exterior electric meter needed replacing. He talked a good game. Almost all of my basement electrical work was already in place because I was putting a one bedroom apartment in where a one bedroom apartment used to be. I simply needed some finishing work done. After he left he called the city to request they put a stop work order on me. The City inspector was at my house within 15 minutes. It turned out to be the best thing he could've done for me. The city inspector told me neither my breaker box nor my outside meter needed replacing. They did not put a stop work order on me because almost all my electrical work was pre-existing. Turns out A1 was just feeding me a line to run up a huge estimate for things that did not need replacing. They'll never get my business. They aren't trustworthy and they're willing to tell you things need replacing when they don't just to run up the bill. His estimate to finish wiring 2 rooms where most of the electrical was already in place from the previous apartment was almost 5k. I'm really glad the inspector came out and let me know most of the estimate wasn't required to pass an inspection. I'm now free to find an honest electrician. I plan to call a couple of them on Monday. If this guy gives you an estimate plz be sure to get a second opinion. It could save you thousands.",,"Shari Fox","ChIJz-6Re8zLiYgRoeb_SE-zVsY","1"

The work was done 8/23/22 and no one has contacted us about this. Other than this I was satisfied with with work.

"We had one light that flickered and popped.  There were three other switches within that box.  I called two other places, one strictly did commercial, the other called me back 8 hours after I left my message at their time of opening and informed me that they could have someone out in the next month or so... flicker... pop.

Lenny informed me that his schedule was booked but he will come in the afternoon.  Inspection of the light switch proved that it was installed at the cheapest possible way, and the wiring was not even grounded.  Possible fire hazard... flicker... pop.

A one light switch fix became an entire rewire on the housing kit with grounding, and he also fixed a light source within my garage.

We are grateful for Lenny taking my call and understanding the severity of what would happen if he did not come here accordingly.

I will always recommend Lenny.  He did an awesome job.  As far as the other companies, now i understand why there's a limited amount of reviews.",,"n8","ChIJz-6Re8zLiYgRoeb_SE-zVsY","5"

"NOT LICENSED OR BONDED AS CLAIMED! Our family hired Leonard, the owner of A-1 Electrical, for several jobs including wiring a finished basement, motorhome shed, and adding electrical for an upcoming mother-in-law suite. We paid him and his apprentice nearly $8,000 total and the work was left unfinished. When we raised it to his attention he PROMISED us he would be back to finish - once other contractors were out of the way. After a brief conversation tonight, not only did he fire his wonderful apprentice, he has refused to finish the agreed work and voided our contract. My elderly mother-in-law is left with an unfinished electrical, including lights and fixtures. Leonard said we could ""finish it ourselves.""

"I’d recommend Danny to anyone! He replaced my old 6” recessed  can lights to the new Led replacements. He was very knowledgeable on how much money I would save per year by using a lower wattage Led fixture versus the high wattage Par 38 bulbs that were in my particular cans. He also explained the benefits on my electrical bill with the reduction of heat from the LED’s. Thanks Danny!! The lighting is great, I got an education, and I’m Saving Money 💰.

"We just moved into the Fairhope area.

Dan Hamner of Hamner Electrical Services was hired to install a ceiling fan in the living room. He was prompt, courteous and very professional.

While he was at the house, I had mentioned that a few days ago three of my electrical outlets had stopped working.

Dan checked all the outlets and found that there was a problem with one particular line. He went up into my attic and discovered that someone (previous owner?) had spliced an additional electric line into the existing living room line.

That splice job had apparently come loose a few days ago and started to arc. The splice wasn't even contained within an electrical box. It was just wire nutted and taped. Dan cut out and brought down the old splice and you could smell that it had burned.

Dan mounted a proper electrical box in the attic and connected the wiring up to code.

His willingness to investigate something that he wasn't even originally hired for, most likely saved my house from burning down.

If that doesn't qualify as a real recommendation, I don't know what would.",,"Bradley Lanser","ChIJU4IPujYJmogRZPsPymXWpMI","5"

I would recommend him to anyone but i would clearly get things in writing because he has never sent my receipt over email as he said he would.

"I recently had the pleasure of working with Joseph, who installed a Tesla charger at my home, and I couldn't be more impressed with his work. From the moment he arrived, it was clear that he was a true professional—punctual, courteous, and extremely knowledgeable.

The installation was done flawlessly, with Joseph taking the time to explain every step of the process and ensuring that everything was up to code. He was meticulous in his work, paying attention to every detail, and the result was a clean, efficient setup that works perfectly.

What really stood out was his commitment to safety and quality. He double-checked all the connections and even gave me a thorough walkthrough of how to use the charger effectively. His expertise gave me complete confidence that the job was done right.

And to top it all off, his pricing was the best in town! I did my research beforehand, and master electrician offered the most competitive rate without compromising on quality.

If you're looking for an electrician who is not only skilled but also genuinely cares about delivering top-notch service at a great price, I highly recommend master electrician, I will definitely be calling him for any future electrical needs.

"Jackie and his team did the original electrical work on our new construction in 2015 and we were very pleased with the quality and value of their work.
More recently, after a short circuit in one of our basement rooms Jackie wasn't our first call but should have been.  Mr. Electric was the panicked first call and for $600 DIDN'T fix the problem but wanted to start tearing out drywall and wanted another $1,200 to do so!
Thankfully we didn't take Mr. Electric up on their quote.  We called Jackie who showed up with his team to troubleshoot AND fix the problem.  They even offered advice on an unrelated HVAC issue that ended up SAVING us $$$.  Even better, no drywall was harmed and we gladly paid a very small fraction of the other quote with everything done correctly in about an hour.",,"Alec Bierbauer","ChIJgz_77PEUYogR_9vVfVl0Pkg","5"

"I called needing help at midnight, no electricity coming into the house, the box outside below the meter just died. I left a msg, explaining my problem the best I could, 4 minutes later I received a text stating they would be there in the morning & it asking for my address. I sent the address & wrote I had to be some place by 9 am. I got a text back immediately that they would see me at 7:30 in the morning. They texted to say they were on their way. A phone call saying they were here & asked if my dogs would bite, plus asked if it was it OK to come onto the property due to my threatening no tresspassing sign, lol. The problem was more than my phone msg stated, oops, I didn't know how bad it was. BUT after giving me an estimate they went & got the needed parts immediately. The estimate was very reasonable, the final cost was within the estimate. Since the power company had to come shut off the at the pole before the work could be done safely, the wait for them to come back to turn it back on seemed like forever. After the power company turned the power back on & they made sure everything outside was working correctly They did come in the house to turn the inside breaker on to be certain that everything worked correctly & to be sure I was satisfied with the work before they left.
I would highly recommend them.
An estimate was given & approved prior to work starting
Prices are extremely reasonable.
Communication is great.
They knew I needed to get the electric running quickly & did the job in a timely manner.
They did not leave before knowing I was satisfied with the job.",,"Jan H","ChIJySnimH3_4YoRTiZzAXS6SoA","5"

"If you are looking for an electrician with integrity, Chris Padgett is who you want. I have used Chris twice now. The first time he wired a 2,100 sqft building which had garage space and living quarters. The second time he wired our 2,100 sqft custom home. He walked through the house plans with us and asked us what we wanted. But he also thought of things that we did not think of like lights in some of our attic spaces and crawl space, door bells, under cabinet lights and
exhaust fans. He does not cut corners. He uses heavier gauge line and does each job like it is his own. He is very responsive. He shows up when he says he will and he will treat you with respect. After dealing with many different sub contractors, I can honestly say Chris has been the easiest to work with and his work was one of the few which was done right the first time.

He came back out the lighting in back of home now works but the original problem still exists. I've paid him $600 in less than one week! I now have to start over and find a REPUTABLE electrician.Amgi needs to vet the workers better BEFORE ADVERTISING THEM ON YOUR APP!",,"Angela Destiny","ChIJ0e9ydrTLjIgRMkvaE3nTaho","1"
"This man is like an Airhead when it comes to Electric work. There is no way he should have a license. It took him 2+ months to do a hour or 2 worth of work. Some of the extra time he took at my home is repaing the walls he damaged in my home and waiting for the proper paint color match to arrive. Don't let this man near your home or business. His name is Gary and his Assistant is Terrance who has even less of a clue!",,"Colette Rutledge","ChIJ0e9ydrTLjIgRMkvaE3nTaho","1"
"This electrician is a disaster. Gary arrived at my home on 10/31/23 to provide a quote to update wiring on a 3-way switch in my kitchen. I agreed on his price and he showed up late the following week with a helper, who was a professional young man, unlike Gary.

After pulling switch plates and switches out of boxes. Gary decided he started too late and would need to return another day. I explained my travel requirements and the upcoming holiday and he agreed to return the following Thursday. He left my home with exposed LIVE wires and filthy finger prints all over my walls, despite doing no work!

The following Thursday Gary was a no show!!!! When I called he apologized and said he forgot or got too busy. I told him to return to my property to put my switch boxes back the way they were and collect his materials. I called him again on 11/17 about his intentions to put my boxes back together and he made more excuses about his assistant no longer working for him( no surprise) and he could come on Thursday…Thanksgiving!!!! I told him no and that I have family coming over and this is a hazard that has to be correct asap. He told me he would get back to me.

When I told him I would report this to the county, he said whatever.

This man is a disaster and unprofessional. Run!",,"M Phillips","ChIJ0e9ydrTLjIgRMkvaE3nTaho","1"

"If it was possible to give 0 stars I would. These people never answer the phone. When they do answer you get the owner of the company and he proceeds to tell you that his technician will call you back but he never does. My warranty company dispatched this company on April 8th to fix my washing machine. It is now  may 4th. I called around the 18-20 to get an update from the company and they told me they didn’t have my work order number. Never once did they think to call me or my warranty company to get the work order number. This is terrible customer service. The straw that broke my back was the owner last week scheduled and appointment for today may 4th to come fix my washer. I called the company twice and didn’t get an answer. I had to call my warranty company to get them to answer and come to find out they won’t be at my house until tomorrow. Never once did they call to tell me this.

"To start they had already no-showed. They then showed up over an hour late. They were supposed to install outlets in my detached garage, and power to the shop as well. In the process of doing this, they damaged the wiring in the ground. They dug directly where other wires lay, and cut them. Then they repaired them with electrical tape alone, in an area where it floods. This is not the proper fix for this! We went not even two months and realized that they killed the line that goes to our well, leaving us without water. They will now not answer any phone calls, texts, or voicemails even before we knew that this is what they had done. Everything about this has been shady and beyond poor professionalism.

They usually take my money and do not complete the job or the work is shoddy and I have to call in someone else to do the job correctly and pay more. This was the very first time I called a contractor that responded immediately and did everything top notch. I lost power due to a storm. The utility company came out to the house and cut the power to prevent a fire. I called Troy and he was at the house the next day to do the work. Not only did he repair the meter, he called and coordinated the inspection and had the utility company come back out and restore the power all on the same day of the repair. He was in constant communication with me letting me know what was happening each step; and went above and beyond by going back and forth to my house to meet the Inspector and double check to make sure the power was restored. For all of his hard work, his price was ""extremely"" reasonable. Without a doubt, I would recommend Troy to anyone needing any electrical work. Thank you so much for getting my power back on.

Kevin of Echols Electical reached out and let me know he was on his way, he got here around 5:30 pm and refused to leave until the job was done, and we were able to call the power company to come inspect and reconnect, so we would not be left without power through out the night! This man and and his crew were absolutely amazing from start to finish! And they were lifesavers! They worked for several hours after business hours in the non stop pouring rain to ensure that our family did not have to continue to go without power. And they did an awesome job.

Not only that, but he found some very questionable work that had been done in the past and fixed the things someone else had done incorrectly--potentially dangerous situations that could have caused a fire.
He was thorough, diligent and determined to make sure everything was repaired, updated and working correctly before he called it done.  Our situation was quite a mess and he traced everything down and made it right along with giving us advice about how to install things in the future.  His helper Colt is a great young man and a hard worker, as well.

"I just wanted to say that Mr. Echols and his crew were fabulous. I requested a quote to run power out to our barn and he came and not only gave a quote but finished the project sooner then was expected. I wanted to surprise my husband with this venture before he came home from his hunting trip. I had mentioned this to Mr. Echols, that I just wanted to at least get a quote before my husband came home. He promptly asked my husband’s return date and not only met it but did so without pressure of me asking. Like I said, above my expectations. The day he came to do the work was the day my husband was returning, he kept asking when I expected his arrival time. He almost met it, would it have not been for the foundation of our garage. I am glad Mr. Echols was just finishing up when my husband pulled in because he could meet Mr. Echols and go over all of the technical stuff that was done. Not only would I recommend his services, I will be using them again soon for an upcoming project. Mr. Echols has made our prestigious list of servicemen we trust, will recommend and will use again.

"I was just leaving a great review for another service and I checked to see if Vance had google set up. Do not ever use this company!!! This is a guy that charges a fortune ($120/hr), lies, misrepresents himself, does not give invoice until after you have paid, charged for drive to Home Depot, and had the audacity to talk bad about another lady he was working for that complained about the ridiculous high price charged!! He truly charges more an hour than Physicians charge for surgery!! My exhusband had utilized him to change out our doorbell. (One of pics available) Well after I dealt with Vance and his girlfriend I complained to my ex (was one reason I used Vance to work on my outside lights for safety reasons) So come to find out Vance had charged my ex a huge amount but I was not aware. When I received the invoice AFTER I had written check I saw how much was charged-even $200 for another guy to climb a ladder to change light. I am now living on a fixed income and to have paid all this money made me so upset at the time but the fact it’s been a a year and a half I am furious when I think of him and what he did to me. And he bought a light set that was the exact same unit. And when he took the old one to his van to use I noticed and asked for it to donate to some one that may need he made a remark. Well not until he left did I realize the box was the exact same. I called the girlfriend because she was kind to me. I told her I felt he needed to return some of the funds, especially since I could have saved over a hundred driving to buy parts. Keep in mind his family has lived in my neighborhood for many years. But I told the girlfriend if he chose to continue in bad business practices I would write it off as huge lesson learned.

"My husband and I were having power surges that we didn't understand (on a Saturday, when the power company could only be reached by automated calls). I called Brian, and he was at my house within 15 minutes. He reviewed our situation, thoroughly checked our equipment, and explained to us that the problem was actually with the local power company. His assessment of the problem was correct.  My husband and I feared that calling an electrician could result in high costs/expenses and not calling an electrician could result in fire or dangers to our family. Because we didn't understand the problem, we could easily be taken advantage of. Brian alleviated those fears. He clearly intends to help others. He even showed us that we had a wire socket ready for a generator, if we were to buy one, that we did not know we had.

The work they performed was upgrading my service panel from 200 to 400amp service.

Wiring in a transfer switch for my whole home generator.

Trenching over 200 foot under a side walk and across a gravel drive and encasing wiring in conduit to building.

And lastly providing a 100 amp service to the building with new service panel.

Thank you very much guys.",,"Justin Cooper","ChIJxdWSLIoTiogRmRGO64XvuuI","5"
